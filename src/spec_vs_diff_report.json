  "summary": "Diff adds bouquet-specific CSS animation keyframes/classes (1s fade-in) and a glow element/animation in global CSS; App.tsx is updated (truncated) and is described as using the new bouquet fade-in and glow on the accepted view. However, due to truncation, reduced-motion behavior, bouquet sizing, and “only bouquet fades” constraints cannot be fully verified from the provided evidence.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "With prefers-reduced-motion enabled, the bouquet does not animate (or uses a near-instant transition).",
      "reason": "The diff shows new bouquet animation keyframes/classes, but the provided/truncated CSS does not include verifiable prefers-reduced-motion overrides specifically disabling/shortening the bouquet animation.",

      "requirement": "With prefers-reduced-motion enabled, the glow does not pulse (static glow or removed).",
      "reason": "The diff adds a glow-pulse keyframe and a .bouquet-glow rule with an animation property, but the rule is truncated and no verifiable prefers-reduced-motion override for stopping the pulsing glow is visible.",

      "requirement": "The bouquet image remains the same size/footprint as before (w-56 h-56 object-contain).",
      "reason": "App.tsx (where the accepted view markup would set the bouquet image classes) is truncated, so the bouquet image sizing classes cannot be confirmed.",
