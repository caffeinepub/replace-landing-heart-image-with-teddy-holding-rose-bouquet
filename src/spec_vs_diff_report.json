  "summary": "Diff adds an \"arena\"-bounded random repositioning for the No button with overlap checking against the Yes button and a smooth CSS transform transition. However, the proximity-based trigger and touch-trigger behavior are not directly verifiable from the truncated App.tsx content provided. The diff also appears to introduce unrelated visual/style changes and potentially new \"heart burst\" behavior not requested by the BuildRequest.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "Change the evasive trigger so the “No” button moves only when the cursor approaches it (proximity-based), rather than moving immediately on hover/enter; touch continues to dodge on touch interaction.",
      "reason": "The diff shows movement utilities (findSafePosition/moveNoButton) but the actual event wiring/logic for proximity threshold detection (e.g., pointermove distance checks) and explicit touch-dodge handling is not visible in the provided truncated App.tsx. Without seeing the proximity computation and touch handlers, this cannot be confirmed implemented.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Ensure the “No” button never gets hidden under/behind the “Yes” button during or after movement (stacking order and/or overlap avoidance).",
      "reason": "Overlap avoidance is partially evidenced via checkOverlap(), but the additional requirement that the No button never appears behind the Yes button (z-index/stacking during animation) is not verifiable from the truncated code (no visible z-index or layering rules in the provided snippet).",

      "description": "Heart-burst click effect logic added to the Yes button (creating burst particles and timed cleanup).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly constrained changes to refining the No button’s evasive behavior; adding a new burst effect on Yes click is outside that scope.",

    },
    {
      "description": "Global theme/style changes (romantic OKLCH palette variables, additional animations, background pattern styling).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest non-goals include changing the existing Valentine theme/copy/Yes flow beyond what’s required for the No button behavior; these global CSS/theme additions are not requested for the evasive-button refinement.",
