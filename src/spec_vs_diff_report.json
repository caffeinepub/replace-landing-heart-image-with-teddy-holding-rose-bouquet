  "summary": "Diff appears to implement the core goal of keeping the “Yes” button fixed by locking its position and preserving layout space when the “No” button becomes evasive, and indicates removal of “Yes” hover/active movement effects. However, the diff also shows a new movement throttle for the “No” button which was not requested and may alter the evasive behavior beyond what’s necessary.",

    {
      "description": "Added throttling/cooldown to “No” button movement (400ms) which changes the evasive algorithm timing/behavior.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly asks to keep the existing evasive “No” button behavior intact except for changes required to prevent “Yes” movement; adding a movement cooldown is a behavioral change not mentioned in REQ-1/REQ-2.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx (truncated): \"// Throttle movement (cooldown of 400ms)\"",
        "frontend/src/App.tsx (truncated): \"if (now - lastMoveTimeRef.current < 400) return;\""
