  "summary": "REQ-1 asks for a very narrow change: update text content of exactly five specific emoji <span> elements in the accepted view, with no other UI/text/behavior changes. The diff shows broad changes to App.tsx (new burst/evasive-button logic, refs/state, etc.) and does not provide direct code evidence that only those five spans were edited. Additional non-requested features appear to have been implemented.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Update only the 5 selected <span> elements in the accepted view (the five bouncing emoji spans) so that each span’s text content becomes exactly: \"❤ 🥰 😏 💋💌\", while keeping all existing classes (including animate-bounce and delay classes), layout, and behavior unchanged.",
      "reason": "The provided App.tsx diff is truncated and does not show the accepted-view emoji spans being updated. Additionally, App.tsx contains substantial behavioral/UI logic changes beyond editing those five spans, which conflicts with the requirement to change only the spans’ text content.",
